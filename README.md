# Pytorch daily challenges (hope so)
# IN PROGRESS


<img src = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/96/Pytorch_logo.png/800px-Pytorch_logo.png">


This repository will contain information which made me crazy to 
avoid reading the same papers day by day and wasting time for things that I did in the past. 

1. Because of lack of comprehensive guides of how to use Pytorch on simple task this repo should be helpful. 
2. At the very early stage I decided to implement simple vonv nets classifiers to show how Pytorch behave and 

3. to learn how to deal with predictions/transforms on single images. 


Repositories contain:

- data loader section
- Model Architecture section
- Model training 
- Prediction on single image


#### Reminder 

Ill try to improve this repo in daily routine




# This is not an normal readme file. It will be normal in few days. 




## Mnist cnns 

#### Dataset is just data.utils.dataset MNIST




## Flower detection 

#### Data source

- <a href = "https://www.kaggle.com/alxmamaev/flowers-recognition"> FLower dataset </a>




# To do 

Next: Char - RNN poem generator
