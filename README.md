# Pytorch daily challenges (hope so)

This repository will contain information which made me crazy to 
avoid reading the same papers day by day and wasting time for things that I did in the past. 

1. Reminders

There is an enourmous problem with deep learnign cases especcialy in self-learner environments (below I listed why):

# This is not an normal readme file. It will be normal in few days. 
### What is going on 

- there is no good behaviours that people would like to attempt
- deep learning and machine learning community is just an naive bunch of morons (on early stage) and they want to simple explain simple tasks with complex word that are not understable by anybody (and btw people aare afraif to ask what is going on)
- knowledge is far away in our daily tasks list, we just want to have everything done very fast. Which in my opinion is the most common mistake in every coding project. 
- dont fool us and ourselves on test/valid dataset please for god sake how can u find it useful and how can u life in proper way if u cheat on as simple task as splitting train/valid dataset. 


## Mnist cnns 
## Flower detection 

- model save 
- model pred
- model prepare
- how to properly use random sampler with pytorch



# To do 



-Char Rnn
- Seq 2 Seq

- Time series rnn pred


This is part of my #dontgetcrazybecauseyouhavepotential challenge. Give me a like if you like leaving a like pls. I have high leve of self esteem because I am barely sure that nobody will read this .
